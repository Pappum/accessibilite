00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500


00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,200
Website make your thinking about having
your first one make

00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,510
form maybe you just need a new better
one

00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,360
in any case you should know at least
some basics about web design

00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,890
and no worries it will only take three
minutes.First of all

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,740
let's face it the website is the core
you're on line marketing activities

00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,810
if you look at all the marketing
channels and techniques what they

00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,629
actually do is bring visitors to your
website and the main purpose of a website

00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,890
is turning these visitors into customers
in marketing terms

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,339
this is called conversion a bad website
will basically cause you to waste money

00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:43,930
and other marketing methods

00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,650
because you don't need more visitors
if you can't turn them into customers

00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,610
so the better your website is the more
visitors are converted into your customers

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,040
and it doesn't really matter whether
your sell consumer products online

00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,769
provide local services or build houses.
Many people in the industry call

00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,180
them selves web designers

00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,290
but they really are just a bunch of
geeks with some basic coding knowledge

00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:09,909
of course without much planning they
will pretty quickly create a website for your

00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,719
with lots of information photos, contacts,
but, the question is,

00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:17,750
is that the way to turn the visitors
into your customers

00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,390
is that we need and the answer is simple
NO.

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,380
What you have to do is look for someone
serious about web design

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,520
well, that's where we come in. This is how
we

00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,520
make website by following this 7-piece
web design process

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,929
phase one, analysis the first step is
always about

00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,609
information gathering, identifying things
like the website purpose

00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:43,350
Goals and target audience. Phase two,
planning

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,600
a plan includes the definition of the
site map, structure

00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,729
and technologies that were about to
use.  Phase three,

00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:53,200
design no only do we focus on wire frame
models

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,789
and the usual style in this stage but
also on the usability of the user

00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:59,840
interface for the best possible user
experience.

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,990
Phase four,

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,908
content a very important part of the
process is choosing to write text, photos

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:09,259
or videos all optimized not only for your
visitors but

00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:12,769
also for search engines. Phase Five,
development

00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,930
here actually create the website using
in the Hypertext Markup Language and

00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,700
cascading style sheet with some help
from databases

00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,170
in other technologies as well if needed
and websites can accessible to

00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,880
mobile devices too.

00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,680
Phase Six, testing, we test all the technical
features

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,239
like code and scripts compatibility with
major browsers but, we also ask ourselves

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,720
if the website really fulfilled its
purpose. Phase Seven,

00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,170
deployment after we launch the site our
job is definitely not done yet

00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:46,149
we always monitor what's happening
after the start enabling us to fix any

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,750
possible deficiencies

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,799
and if you want we can also manage to
future maintenance

00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:56,060
and updates for you. As you've just seen
Web Design is a very complex process

00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,280
but we believe this is how website
should be done and

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,769
